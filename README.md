# HPC Advanced User: Teaching performance programming to scientists

This is a new lesson built with [The Carpentries Workbench][workbench]. 

The HPC Advanced User Software Carpentry lesson is aimed at researchers with
some background in using scientific computing.
This lesson will teach scientists to understand and deal with performance issues
that arise when moving from a personal computer
to a High-Performance Computing (HPC) environment (a SuperComputer).
The basic concepts
that affect performance are covered in a general manner, then a survey of
the capabilities and performance of many languages commonly used in
scientific computations are discussed along with example codes illustrating
the performance concerns of each language.  Each person who completes this lesson
should have a good general overview of what each computer language can
do and what performance bottlenecks to avoid.

## Prerequisites

Each user must begin with some knowledge of Linux and at least one
of the languages that this lesson covers (Python, R, C/C++, Fortran, Matlab).
The examples in the first part of this lesson are currently available in 
Python, R, C/C++, and Fortran but Matlab examples still need to be added.
Each user may also need to know how to run
jobs in an HPC environment.  These prerequisites may all be covered by
having an HPC Unix Shell carpentry lesson taught right before this one.
